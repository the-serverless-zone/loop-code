# How-to guide on alerts testing

1. Makes sure you have confirmation of task 1 & 2 before proceeding. It is helpful to have slack and sms open during testing. 

2. In your company AWS account Go to AWS lambda. Create two test lambdas. On the test page, press "TEST". 

3. Press the "TEST" button 5 or more times in as many seconds. If you wish, set this test up for multiple lambdas.

4. In two to four minutes, your alerts should appear on your phone, slack and email.
